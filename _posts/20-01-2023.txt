20-01-2023 Working on practical things

As you see in the title, I made the only correct choice
and decided to work on Adblock things. Since it's all new
to me I got tired very quickly, therefore this entry will
be rather short.

Security stuff is scary. This could be a whole another
paragraph, but apparently you can try to identify users by
ad-bombing them and checking which ones get blocked and
which ones do not. 

The whole ad stuff is a bit confusing to me as well. The thing
I'm doing should be very very simple from the theoretical
point of view, because it's just compressing some number of
expressions into a smaller one, which express the same thing.
And that is a very standard problem. Yet someone has to do it
and that someone is probably me.
