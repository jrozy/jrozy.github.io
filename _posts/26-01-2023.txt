26-01-2023 Maybe back to the old ways?

First of all, I don't get why, but I get super stressed
about going to meetings. Probably it's the awful impact
that this whole internship had on me. Therefore I arrived
at work at like 2pm, which is not good for anyone and
especially my leaving early. I talked about it to my
supervisor during the meeting though, I'm not sure I'll
have time to take advantage of the psychological suppport
line today, but I probably should. I should actually 
promise myself to do it either today or tomorrow after
work.

Anyways, I put a thing in the title and don't worry, I'm not
giving up on doing stuff for Adblock. Just... my supervisor
showed me how to turn that problem into a research problem.
And solving that research problem sounds quite nice. And then
I can help explaining my paper on that research problem to
someone that will be actually developing Adblock based on that
paper. This way I can avoid coding. And that is so much better
for me because I hate coding so much. And more importantly I'm
solving a research problem, which is something I've done many
many many times. Not some practical stuff. Yet when someone
asks me what I'm doing for work, I can give them the Adblock
motivation. Becuase that's the real online-life problem that
I started from. It feels like the best of both worlds. Now
I just need to acquire the skill to turn real life problems
into math problems so that I can solve real life problems
using math.
