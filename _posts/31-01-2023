31-01-2023 Arriving too early

So today I've managed to pair up the late departure from the first week of work with early arrival today. It's good to learn when your office building opens and closes within the first month of working there, right? And I had to learn both the hours the hard way. At least the security guard was nice to me and let me in before 8am :D

I also was supposed to have a meeting today, but then one of my supervisors got sick and the other one assumed that means the meeting is cancelled. Fortunately I was annoying enough for him to reschedule it 4 hours later and we got it done. The unfortunate part was the fact that I haven't really done a thing in these 4 hours, unless you count putting together puzzles in the building's chill room as doing a thing. Well nothing work related that is. I prepared for the meeting though and did some paperwork, so it isn't the worst day ever. In fact it's probably better than most of my meeting days. Oh also, today was my first not completely miserable meeting day, so that's gotta count for something.
