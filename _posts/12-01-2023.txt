12-01-2023 New Year's celebration day I guess?

I feel like I spent a lot of time today not working... 
Yea, something like 4 hours of my 7,5h day. And that is with
considering writing this blog as part of my workday, which
it is to some extend. Hey, it makes me try to put all the
research I worked on into not only my own words, but words
that are understandable to a **wider audience** also known as
my friends.

Anyways, first of all there was a lunch break and those are
pretty long. In fact when I met a person from Human Resources
team to explain me how working here looks like, I learnt that
the lunch break is mandatory and it's supposed to take between
45 minutes and 2 hours. I'll take that. But that's normal. Then
I took my standard 15 minute break and I saw some people playing
table soccer downstairs and someone was winning 1v2 way too
easily, so I joined his team to nerf him. It worked :P Finally
I tried to get back to work and then there was some celebration
when director of this research center was telling us about how
amazing we did last year and how amazing we are or something.
Cool. We also got galette, which is some French dessert, it was
pretty great. And after I came back to my office I noticed that
I want to leave in an hour. So there went the whole day.

I can still say a couple of things about research, because this
blog is a bit pointless if I don't? So people that don't explain
a notation in a definition that's central to the paper are 
really annoying. And also you can use graphs with fancy labels
to store data without really harming your ability to ask
questions about it. And it makes sense to not copy that every
presentation of Cries and Whispers was directed by Bergman
(I have no idea about movies, I'm taking that example from a
book on databases) or Ullman plays in every presentation of
Cries and Whispers, but storing all the information well
requires some creativity. Graphical representations are helpful.
