18-01-2023 Finishing up things

It seems as though I'm almost done with a thorough read
of my first paper during this PhD. And it might be something
that my work will be related to later. Anyways thorough reads
are a lot of work and time - this one took me 2 weeks. It
should get faster as I learn the terminology used in database
theory, but for now it'll be taking a while.

Also I would like to give an apology to the other 2 notions
of provenance which I called not pretty or useless in some
previous blog. Because not every ideal notion is always
accessible. And this is what the other 2 notions are. They
aren't the prettiest, but at least they're always computable
and you can always talk to them about your data. And that's
very appreciated.

I also just learned that my doctorate school needs to be called
in order to give me my documents or register me. Sigh! I guess
I'll do it when I get back home.

And finally I went through some paper that tries to perform
operations on data which is stored in the compact way. And 
that's usually cool. But the operations they're performing
are related to machine learning. I don't know a thing about
machine learning. I guess I'll have to learn. Or skip that
part. I like skipping that part.
