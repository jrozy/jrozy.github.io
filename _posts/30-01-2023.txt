30-01-2023 Many many problems

Don't worry, it's not real-life problems. It's research
problems that the title is about. And many research problems
is a good thing. Granted most of them are like applying the
same small change to every question I previously had, so the
number or problems I'm getting gets artificially multiplied
by 6. But the cool thing is, I don't have answers to any of
them. I drew a graph of "if I know how to answer this, then 
I know how to answer that". And it actually has many arrows
and everything has either an incoming or an outgoing arrow.
And that is also cool, because that means I haven't flew away
to another planet while I was trying to figure out different
questions about the initial problem Google gave Adblock.

Also I don't get how people work 8 hours a day. I've worked
for like 6, but in reality like 4 and I'm crazy tired. I guess
it's busywork that they're doing a lot of the time and today
I was doing mostly creative thinking, which is by far the most
exhausting part of being a PhD. And also I let myself get 
frustrated by technical issues. Turns out being frustrated
makes you tired, who would've thought.
