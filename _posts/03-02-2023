03-02-2023 First French course!

So I did my first French course! I was in the beginners
group, which felt slightly strange because I wasn't a
complete begineer. But I suppose I'm closer to that than
to any level of competence. Also I was the only european
person in that class, other than a teacher. But at least
half the people in that group speak Indo-European
languages as their primary ones, so maybe they won't have
that much harder than me. The other half speaks Chinese,
so they might have a little bit of a harder time. Or maybe
not, because everyone speaks English which is more similar
to French than Polish, Urdu, Hindi, Farsi or Chinese. 

Also I can finally use my laptop, so I spent most of my
"research" part of the day setting up latex and writing
blogs and emails. Not very researchy, but that's alright.
I'm still frustrated, so probably better to come back to
research after the weekend when that hopefully goes away.
