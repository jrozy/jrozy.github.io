13-01-2023 Not focused

Basically a description of today. I found it really difficult
to focus on anything or do anything at work. Might have 
something to do with noticing that a game I play in my free
time got an exciting patch in the morning and really wanting
to try it? Anyways, it felt so not good I might try to count
this as half a day off, because there was no progress at all.

This is also a downside of being dilligent about administrative
things you can do - there is none of them left for when your
brain just doesn't work.

Now that I'm looking at my meeting notes I've noticed that
I even made a note that setting up a website would be this
proactive procastenation. I wish I tried doing that, but I
guess I didn't.

I've also heard from my supervisors that having 3 papers I'm
working on is not a bad thing at all as you can come back
to them and remember them better thanks to that. I also know
that I should read and try to remember as much as possible
at this stage since I don't know what will become useful yet.
Though honestly... I can't wait until I have a scientific
topic so that I can know what I need and what I don't need
and start working towards a goal instead.
