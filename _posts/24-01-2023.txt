24-01-2023 New stuff

So first of all, no post yesterday because I took a day off.
And that was because I can't really manage my own well-being,
especially on weekends. But this blog is mostly about working
as a PhD student, so I'm not going to get into the details
of how messed up my mental state is.

I moved onto the adblock thingies and I'm very unsure of what
I'm doing. I don't even know how to write about it. It is so
overwhelming. I don't think writing the algorithm I need is
going to be easy, because it's some sort of split up a lot of
things into pieces that look similar sorta thing. Those are
usually tough.

Also I was looking for documentation and I felt like it was
a bit messy. Yes, I curse you Google. Might be because I'm not
used to searching stuff for work straight up on the Internet,
but I much prefer to do so in papers. I could never find some
number that I really need too. So that's gonna wait for a bit.

Finally it is really nice that I can actually explain what I do
by just saying it. And people actually understand. For most 
people this is probably a normal feeling, but as a mathematician
it's so unusual and great. The non-great part is the fact that
the short description of what I'm doing is that I'm making
AdBlock worse. But it's not my fault, it's Google's fault, okay?
