01-02-2023 I like intense thinking

I'm actually writing most of this two days later, but that
is only because I didn't have my work computer available
and therefore I couldn't submit those. I wrote down some
pieces on Wednesday so that's gonna be helpful.

I didn't feel like going to work early, so I decided to
wake up late and take the morning off. I like having 
flexible hours and taking days off whenever I want to. 
Part of why I took the morning off is that I wanted to
go to some event language school organises to finally talk
to people in real life, not just by through computer screen.

I dropped my work computer off quite a bit before I left,
so a lot of what I was doing was done on paper, therefore
it was mostly creative work. And the creative work was
really really cool and really really exhausting at the same
time. Let me describe it. Firstly I took some steps to 
simplify the problem - I decided to start with just a list
of words rather than list of words and list of regular
expressions and I decided to make one, possibly very long
regular expression of shortest possible length rather
than few regular expressions which have limited length.
Then I started looking at how we can compress things well
and it looks like it's mostly down to common prefixes and
suffixes that I can use for compression. So I run 1 method
based on prefixes, the other one based on suffixes. And
then I found a couple of nasty examples where the compression
using these methods is far from optimal. And one of those
examples also said that mixing up the methods won't be
easy either.
