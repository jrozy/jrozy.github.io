02-02-2023 Technology doesn't work

I am gonna start this on a positive note - the social event
last night was really really cool. I tried to talk in French,
Spanish until I finally decided that it's time to stop
torturing myself and sat down at the English-speaking table.
And I've met a cool girl there, who was an undergrad that
is very very passionate about research. That's the "Hello
me from 3-4 years ago!" moment. I don't think she'll be
reading this, but maybe some other undergrad that's passionate
about research will, so I want to drop some advice from my
own experience. First of all, never give up and never let
anyone tell you that you need to study instead of trying
to do research. There is no better way of learning how to
do research than just doing it. Second piece of advice would
be that research internships are cool. I only really did one,
but I've learned a lot about the way I work and what happens
when you make your passion into a job. Becuase that is a huge
change. Especially since you somewhat need to keep that
passion throughout the PhD. And the third one would probably
be to try things your advisors recommend with an open mind.
That was something that didn't go all that well during my
internship and is going very well in my PhD so far. Because
one obvious truth is that if you're negative about a method
from the start, then it will never work. That placebo effect
(or maybe it's reverse placebo?) or whatever that's called.

And that whole piece about advice to young researchers was
so lengthy mostly becauase I didn't really do anything today
since I couldn't log onto my computer and I wanted to start
writing yesterday's stuff down. Because I've learned from
my internship that I absolutely despise writing a lot at 
once. So I've got to keep the balance between writing and
researching. Anyways, I tried to get my computer to work
for like 4 hours, then gave up and went home, taking the
afternoon off.
