27-01-2023 Another short day

I signed myself up for a French course! It turns out I'm
a complete beginner, who would've thought. It has me a bit
worried that one of the teachers I talked to today barely
speaks English, but I had a Spanish teacher in high school
who talked to us mostly in Spanish since lesson 1 and 
I actually remember quite a bit still. And this is despite
all of my Spanish experience being limited to 3 years of
2 45-minute classes per week (or maybe it was just 1/week?).

For the math stuff, I formally wrote down 5 problems which
are all strongly correlated questions about compressing
lists of words into shortest possible regular expressions.
The next step is to think of the interactions between most
of them and then picking one that is the easiest to approach.

I was also setting up latex because I wanted to send the
statements of the problems to my supervisors and installing
the compiler is quite annoying. Essentially if you don't
search through the options well then it will try to install
every single latex package available. And for those not
familliar with latex - that's a lot. Then it takes 1,5 hours
to unpack all those useless things. Why choose to have Windows
on my work computer again? Pulling directly the packages
I want with Linux systems is so much easier. Oh well, I'll
manage I guess. Either that or reinstall my OS.
