11-01-2023 I don't feel like I'm doing much

I started feeling why being a PhD and especially starting one
can be really difficult at times. It really feels like I'm
just trying to study papers with very little progress done
each month and nothing comes out of it. But then I talked to
my supervisor about this, and apparently taking a week to read
a paper throughly is completely normal, not only that, he said
that it's really good if I manage to thoroughly understand the
paper I was working on in a week. I was stunned by this,
because I normally wouldn't expect taking a week to read a
10-page long document. But I guess that's how researcher life
works. 

I also am trying to learn some other than thorough ways
to read a paper. One of them is supposed to come down to just
reading the introduction and summary and deducing what paper
is about from them. The problem is what if a paper doesn't
have a proper introduction and a summary. Becuase people do
that. Why? Who knows. 

Oh also apparently throwing in spikey brackets around words
in a text documents makes .md files not show what's inside.
I removed them so that the end of yesterday's post makes sense.
