17-01-2023 I'm impressed by my supervisor

I had a meeting today. And during that meeting I've learnt
that one of my supervisors knows absolutely nothing about
what I've been doing in the last 2 weeks. So why did I put
in the title that I'm impressed? It's because my stuff is
really far from his domain, yet he's still trying to listen
and learn what I'm talking about. And that is not a behavior
I'm used to after spending 5 years at Univesity of Warsaw.
Generally I remember that whenever I'd ask a question that
wasn't in the domain of some of my old teachers, they'd try
to redirect me to someone who is more in the domain. Then
person they'd redirect me too wouldn't be too interested
and the topic would die out. So I am very very glad that
this is not the case here.

Also short days are quite nice. I feel a bit tired after the
meeting and I'm taking the afternoon off today to talk to
family and figure out some stuff at home as well. Yet I feel
like I've done a lot, so that is pretty good I think.

I noticed that writing these blogs takes me like 5 minutes too
rather than 30, like it did at the start, so I should probably
look for some new excuse as to why I don't read papers in the
last hour of my work. Or maybe just read the papers or do some
other stuff that's actually useful for work. Nah, I'll maybe
work on my website.
