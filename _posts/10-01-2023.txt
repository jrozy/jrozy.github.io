10-01-2023 Sleeping is good

I've decided to sleep for like 4 hours after sleeping 3 the 
previous day and then go straight into a meeting with my
supervisor. I was super sleepy and couldn't really understand
a thing. So for all PhD students that somehow made it work during
the undergrad/masters - it only really worked because those
studies just aren't that hard. If you wanna actually be able
to work properly, you gotta sleep properly too.

The other realization I had is that being a PhD student is
a wonderful job, but with that wonderful job also comes
a responsibilty to show up to your work ready. And I want to
show up to work ready because what I'm doing is great. None
of this staying up all night for very little reason nonsense.

I've learnt things about the reasons why things didn't make any
sense to me yesterday when reading the paper. Apparently they
wanted to start with properties, but they couldn't prove the
properties -> unique object implication, therefore they had to
settle on some things used in practice -> their properties.
