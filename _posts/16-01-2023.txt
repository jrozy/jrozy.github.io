16-01-2023 Wandering into forest of semirings

Hi there! I'm in a good mood because that's what productive
days do to me. Surprising, right?!

So why was this day very productive? I have no idea really
about the work-organizational reasons, but I'll just write
as much as I remember for what happened early in the day.
If I do the same thing about multiple days when I ended up
in a good mood maybe the correlation will show me a way to
make having good days be a routine rather than an exception.

I didn't really sleep all that much, I had a super lazy morning
and I didn't feel like today was gonna be great. I was pretty
strongly distracted in the metro, I showed up at work at around
11:30, so I figured I'd skip lunch so that I can maybe leave
around roughly 7 hours and not feel too bad about it. Then
I started doing some simple administrative stuff which took
like an hour but wasn't too tiring. And finally after that I
think I reluctantly sat down to reading papers. Oh, before
papers are also made a TODO list and that was probably very
helpful for my mood.

What really made me happy was the fact that I got to experiment
with a certain semiring, which is a called tropical. And it
was important for my work, because there is a mathematically
pretty notion of provenance (if you recall some blog about 
a week ago that I posted provenance is something that tells
you where your knowledge came from), which usually isn't easy
to compute, but if you consider it over a tropical semiring,
then it becomes easy to compute. And that's great!.
So I started searching for semirings that'd behave similarly
to the tropical one and looking for the notion of a semiring
that'd capture the behavior of all semirings where my pretty
notion of provenance is easy to compute.
