This is very very scuffed for now, but hopefully I can bother someone at my workplace soon to help me make this webpage into an actual pretty looking thing. Anyways I think I did pretty well considering that I'm a mathematician that was forced to use Git maybe twice before.

I'll try to keep this blog user-friendly. And hopefully it stays user-friendly for people that don't currently work with me.

16-01-2023 Wandering into forest of semirings

Hi there! I'm in a good mood because that's what productive
days do to me. Surprising, right?!

So why was this day very productive? I have no idea really
about the work-organizational reasons, but I'll just write
as much as I remember for what happened early in the day.
If I do the same thing about multiple days when I ended up
in a good mood maybe the correlation will show me a way to
make having good days be a routine rather than an exception.

I didn't really sleep all that much, I had a super lazy morning
and I didn't feel like today was gonna be great. I was pretty
strongly distracted in the metro, I showed up at work at around
11:30, so I figured I'd skip lunch so that I can maybe leave
around roughly 7 hours and not feel too bad about it. Then
I started doing some simple administrative stuff which took
like an hour but wasn't too tiring. And finally after that I
think I reluctantly sat down to reading papers. Oh, before
papers are also made a TODO list and that was probably very
helpful for my mood.

What really made me happy was the fact that I got to experiment
with a certain semiring, which is a called tropical. And it
was important for my work, because there is a mathematically
pretty notion of provenance (if you recall some blog about 
a week ago that I posted provenance is something that tells
you where your knowledge came from), which usually isn't easy
to compute, but if you consider it over a tropical semiring,
then it becomes easy to compute. And that's great!.
So I started searching for semirings that'd behave similarly
to the tropical one and looking for the notion of a semiring
that'd capture the behavior of all semirings where my pretty
notion of provenance is easy to compute.


13-01-2023 Not focused

Basically a description of today. I found it really difficult
to focus on anything or do anything at work. Might have 
something to do with noticing that a game I play in my free
time got an exciting patch in the morning and really wanting
to try it? Anyways, it felt so not good I might try to count
this as half a day off, because there was no progress at all.

This is also a downside of being dilligent about administrative
things you can do - there is none of them left for when your
brain just doesn't work.

Now that I'm looking at my meeting notes I've noticed that
I even made a note that setting up a website would be this
proactive procastenation. I wish I tried doing that, but I
guess I didn't.

I've also heard from my supervisors that having 3 papers I'm
working on is not a bad thing at all as you can come back
to them and remember them better thanks to that. I also know
that I should read and try to remember as much as possible
at this stage since I don't know what will become useful yet.
Though honestly... I can't wait until I have a scientific
topic so that I can know what I need and what I don't need
and start working towards a goal instead.


12-01-2023 New Year's celebration day I guess?

I feel like I spent a lot of time today not working... 
Yea, something like 4 hours of my 7,5h day. And that is with
considering writing this blog as part of my workday, which
it is to some extend. Hey, it makes me try to put all the
research I worked on into not only my own words, but words
that are understandable to a *wider audience* also known as
my friends.

Anyways, first of all there was a lunch break and those are
pretty long. In fact when I met a person from Human Resources
team to explain me how working here looks like, I learnt that
the lunch break is mandatory and it's supposed to take between
45 minutes and 2 hours. I'll take that. But that's normal. Then
I took my standard 15 minute break and I saw some people playing
table soccer downstairs and someone was winning 1v2 way too
easily, so I joined his team to nerf him. It worked :P Finally
I tried to get back to work and then there was some celebration
when director of this research center was telling us about how
amazing we did last year and how amazing we are or something.
Cool. We also got galette, which is some French dessert, it was
pretty great. And after I came back to my office I noticed that
I want to leave in an hour. So there went the whole day.

I can still say a couple of things about research, because this
blog is a bit pointless if I don't? So people that don't explain
a notation in a definition that's central to the paper are 
really annoying. And also you can use graphs with fancy labels
to store data without really harming your ability to ask
questions about it. And it makes sense to not copy that every
presentation of Cries and Whispers was directed by Bergman
(I have no idea about movies, I'm taking that example from a
book on databases) or Ullman plays in every presentation of
Cries and Whispers, but storing all the information well
requires some creativity. Graphical representations are helpful.


11-01-2023 I don't feel like I'm doing much

I started feeling why being a PhD and especially starting one
can be really difficult at times. It really feels like I'm
just trying to study papers with very little progress done
each month and nothing comes out of it. But then I talked to
my supervisor about this, and apparently taking a week to read
a paper throughly is completely normal, not only that, he said
that it's really good if I manage to thoroughly understand the
paper I was working on in a week. I was stunned by this,
because I normally wouldn't expect taking a week to read a
10-page long document. But I guess that's how researcher life
works. 

I also am trying to learn some other than thorough ways
to read a paper. One of them is supposed to come down to just
reading the introduction and summary and deducing what paper
is about from them. The problem is what if a paper doesn't
have a proper introduction and a summary. Becuase people do
that. Why? Who knows. 

Oh also apparently throwing in spikey brackets around words
in a text documents makes .md files not show what's inside.
I removed them so that the end of yesterday's post makes sense.


10-01-2023 Sleeping is good

I've decided to sleep for like 4 hours after sleeping 3 the 
previous day and then go straight into a meeting with my
supervisor. I was super sleepy and couldn't really understand
a thing. So for all PhD students that somehow made it work during
the undergrad/masters - it only really worked because those
studies just aren't that hard. If you wanna actually be able
to work properly, you gotta sleep properly too.

The other realization I had is that being a PhD student is
a wonderful job, but with that wonderful job also comes
a responsibilty to show up to your work ready. And I want to
show up to work ready because what I'm doing is great. None
of this staying up all night for very little reason nonsense.

I've learnt things about the reasons why things didn't make any
sense to me yesterday when reading the paper. Apparently they
wanted to start with properties, but they couldn't prove the
properties -> unique object implication, therefore they had to
settle on some things used in practice -> their properties.


9-01-2023 Practical is still strange to me

This might be fault of the fact that I slept 3 hours 
or so during the night, but I had a lot of trouble 
grasping concepts today. As a mathematician whenever 
I try to invent a concept that measures something 
or gives me information, I tend to first think of
what do I want from this thing. And today I've ran
into about 10 definitions of various notions of provenance
in a paper (provenance is meant to be some mathematical object
that gives you ready information about the data you have without
having to search for it, at least as far as I understand, 
maybe that's wrong). And having 10 different variants of a certain
measure is fine, because you might use a different one
depending on what you want. But later in the paper I've
learnt, that only 2 of these notions for decent mathematical
objects with nice properties of... for example, always having 
a definition or being able to manage updating the data. 
The worst part is, I read the first notion last week 
and I figured that first notion was a little silly, 
so I came up with how you'd do an improved version of it. 
Guess what, the first notion and the notion I came up are
the only two that have good properties. I'm meeting my 
supervisor tomorrow, hopefully I'll get an explanation to
why all these other notions are mentioned at all, because 
in my eyes they're just useless right now.

6-01-2023 Hello world (of databases)!

New year, new me! Or something like that... All of these new year resolutions where you completely change the way you're doing things work 100% of the time, right..? Well this whole 45/15 techinque or whatever it's called has been working well for a week so that's something. And I also have to have a work calendar, so at least something is organized.

Moving onto maths... I'm saying I'm working on database theory, but what does that really mean? Well a database is just a set of things you know, i.e. facts. Since you're not only smart, but you also studied things for a while, you know a lot. Therefore databases are big. Despite being smart, you probably know that one guy that doesn't really study much, but can figure almost anything out with a speed of a computer program when you tell them him the data from your database of knowledge. Let's call that guy a Datalog program. If you imagine what a person could be if you combined your knowledge and his deduction skills, that hypothetical person could be a rolemodel for many students, therefore we call it a model. And that's a quick real-life explanation to terms used in databases. Oh well terms... that's also a term, but I don't think anyone needs to actually know the way of that one.

Now imagine that your knowledge base is a set of axioms and you want to figure out if your favorite theorem requires axiom of infinity for example. Actually, no, you're cool, so of course it requires the axiom of infinity. Let's go with the axiom of powerset. And not only that, you'd like to also measure how much it relies on the axiom of infinity. Well I have a recipe for you. Recall all the facts that you're using in the proof of your favorite theorem and draw a downwards line from it to each of those facts to the theorem. Then take the proofs of those facts and repeat, until you get to axioms. And then do that for every possible proof. Then you assign a value x to axiom of infinity and value y to the axiom of powerset and 1 to all other axioms. And then for each proof you multiply the values assigned to axioms that show up at the bottom and you add them all up. Oh, infinity is a number now. If your result has a monomial without a y, then you have a proof that doesn't require the axiom of powerset. And if you have x^infinity somewhere there, then you're really cool. This example probably works better on a table of movies, theater locations and the Pariscope (weekly publication that lists cultural events in Paris), but the point of math is to be pretty, not practical :)

I'll try to do these daily, at least on weekdays because I'm supposed to write about what I worked on during the day anyways. And this is a fun way of doing it.
