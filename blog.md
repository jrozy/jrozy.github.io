This is very very scuffed for now, but hopefully I can bother someone at my workplace soon to help me make this webpage into an actual pretty looking thing. Anyways I think I did pretty well considering that I'm a mathematician that was forced to use Git maybe twice before.

I'll try to keep this blog user-friendly. And hopefully it stays user-friendly for people that don't currently work with me.
