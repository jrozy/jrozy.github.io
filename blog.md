This is very very scuffed for now, but hopefully I can bother someone at my workplace soon to help me make this webpage into an actual pretty looking thing. Anyways I think I did pretty well considering that I'm a mathematician that was forced to use Git maybe twice before.

I'll try to keep this blog user-friendly. And hopefully it stays user-friendly for people that don't currently work with me.

14-02-2023 More new languages

I'd really appreciate it if people stopped writing in languages
that I don't understand. First French, now some probabilistic
algorithms. I mindlessly sent some paper on the chat that I
have with my supervisors because the results there looked
interesting from the wording even though I'm not sure what
they meant. And then I found out that these are some
probabilistic nonsense. And yea, I technically majored in maths
with speciality in probability. You know what? I despise
probability. I don't really want to look at that paper.
I'll probably end up doing so anyways, but what have I gotten
myself into.

On the bright side I had a meeting with my supervisors today
and for the first time in a while I was at least partially
productive after it. Only partially, but it's still something.

I'm not sure how I feel about writing these blogs, it's been
more annoying than fun recently. But that's probably temporary.


13-02-2023 I'm lost

First of all, I was sick the rest of the last week,
therefore no blogs, sorry for that.

Today... I don't really know what I was doing today.
I couldn't really bring myself to focus on anything in
particular. Might have something to do with the arguments
that I had with some of my online buddies over the weekend,
but that was... over the previous weekend I think? I don't
even exactly remember what the timeline for anything is.
It feels like there's so much on my mind right now and
I just need to say STOP to one of the things. Or maybe just
resolve them one after the other. I'll try the resolving
thing first. Hopefully tomorrow is better. 

7-02-2023 Feeling sick.

This is gonna be a short one. I don't feel well today
and it's awful to try to work. My brain just doesn't
connect any dots.

I didn't make a blog post yesterday because I stayed
up for way too long. Then I tricked myself into thinking
that I know how to work from home and it turns out that
I don't. It's almost like I already knew that.

Also trying to write down a precise description of an
algorithm is difficult, but more on that tomorrow.


03-02-2023 First French course!

So I did my first French course! I was in the beginners
group, which felt slightly strange because I wasn't a
complete begineer. But I suppose I'm closer to that than
to any level of competence. Also I was the only european
person in that class, other than a teacher. But at least
half the people in that group speak Indo-European
languages as their primary ones, so maybe they won't have
that much harder than me. The other half speaks Chinese,
so they might have a little bit of a harder time. Or maybe
not, because everyone speaks English which is more similar
to French than Polish, Urdu, Hindi, Farsi or Chinese. 

Also I can finally use my laptop, so I spent most of my
"research" part of the day setting up latex and writing
blogs and emails. Not very researchy, but that's alright.
I'm still frustrated, so probably better to come back to
research after the weekend when that hopefully goes away.



02-02-2023 Technology doesn't work

I am gonna start this on a positive note - the social event
last night was really really cool. I tried to talk in French,
Spanish until I finally decided that it's time to stop
torturing myself and sat down at the English-speaking table.
And I've met a cool girl there, who was an undergrad that
is very very passionate about research. That's the "Hello
me from 3-4 years ago!" moment. I don't think she'll be
reading this, but maybe some other undergrad that's passionate
about research will, so I want to drop some advice from my
own experience. First of all, never give up and never let
anyone tell you that you need to study instead of trying
to do research. There is no better way of learning how to
do research than just doing it. Second piece of advice would
be that research internships are cool. I only really did one,
but I've learned a lot about the way I work and what happens
when you make your passion into a job. Becuase that is a huge
change. Especially since you somewhat need to keep that
passion throughout the PhD. And the third one would probably
be to try things your advisors recommend with an open mind.
That was something that didn't go all that well during my
internship and is going very well in my PhD so far. Because
one obvious truth is that if you're negative about a method
from the start, then it will never work. That placebo effect
(or maybe it's reverse placebo?) or whatever that's called.

And that whole piece about advice to young researchers was
so lengthy mostly becauase I didn't really do anything today
since I couldn't log onto my computer and I wanted to start
writing yesterday's stuff down. Because I've learned from
my internship that I absolutely despise writing a lot at 
once. So I've got to keep the balance between writing and
researching. Anyways, I tried to get my computer to work
for like 4 hours, then gave up and went home, taking the
afternoon off.


01-02-2023 I like intense thinking

I'm actually writing most of this two days later, but that
is only because I didn't have my work computer available
and therefore I couldn't submit those. I wrote down some
pieces on Wednesday so that's gonna be helpful.

I didn't feel like going to work early, so I decided to
wake up late and take the morning off. I like having 
flexible hours and taking days off whenever I want to. 
Part of why I took the morning off is that I wanted to
go to some event language school organises to finally talk
to people in real life, not just by through computer screen.

I dropped my work computer off quite a bit before I left,
so a lot of what I was doing was done on paper, therefore
it was mostly creative work. And the creative work was
really really cool and really really exhausting at the same
time. Let me describe it. Firstly I took some steps to 
simplify the problem - I decided to start with just a list
of words rather than list of words and list of regular
expressions and I decided to make one, possibly very long
regular expression of shortest possible length rather
than few regular expressions which have limited length.
Then I started looking at how we can compress things well
and it looks like it's mostly down to common prefixes and
suffixes that I can use for compression. So I run 1 method
based on prefixes, the other one based on suffixes. And
then I found a couple of nasty examples where the compression
using these methods is far from optimal. And one of those
examples also said that mixing up the methods won't be
easy either.



31-01-2023 Arriving too early

So today I've managed to pair up the late departure from
the first week of work with early arrival today. It's good
to learn when your office building opens and closes within 
the first month of working there, right? And I had to learn
both the hours the hard way. At least the security guard was
nice to me and let me in before 8am :D

I also was supposed to have a meeting today, but then one of
my supervisors got sick and the other one assumed that means
the meeting is cancelled. Fortunately I was annoying enough
for him to reschedule it 4 hours later and we got it done.
The unfortunate part was the fact that I haven't really done
a thing in these 4 hours, unless you count putting together
puzzles in the building's chill room as doing a thing. Well
nothing work related that is. I prepared for the meeting
though and did some paperwork, so it isn't the worst day ever.
In fact it's probably better than most of my meeting days.
Oh also, today was my first not completely miserable meeting
day, so that's gotta count for something.


30-01-2023 Many many problems

Don't worry, it's not real-life problems. It's research
problems that the title is about. And many research problems
is a good thing. Granted most of them are like applying the
same small change to every question I previously had, so the
number or problems I'm getting gets artificially multiplied
by 6. But the cool thing is, I don't have answers to any of
them. I drew a graph of "if I know how to answer this, then 
I know how to answer that". And it actually has many arrows
and everything has either an incoming or an outgoing arrow.
And that is also cool, because that means I haven't flew away
to another planet while I was trying to figure out different
questions about the initial problem Google gave Adblock.

Also I don't get how people work 8 hours a day. I've worked
for like 6, but in reality like 4 and I'm crazy tired. I guess
it's busywork that they're doing a lot of the time and today
I was doing mostly creative thinking, which is by far the most
exhausting part of being a PhD. And also I let myself get 
frustrated by technical issues. Turns out being frustrated
makes you tired, who would've thought.


27-01-2023 Another short day

I signed myself up for a French course! It turns out I'm
a complete beginner, who would've thought. It has me a bit
worried that one of the teachers I talked to today barely
speaks English, but I had a Spanish teacher in high school
who talked to us mostly in Spanish since lesson 1 and 
I actually remember quite a bit still. And this is despite
all of my Spanish experience being limited to 3 years of
2 45-minute classes per week (or maybe it was just 1/week?).

For the math stuff, I formally wrote down 5 problems which
are all strongly correlated questions about compressing
lists of words into shortest possible regular expressions.
The next step is to think of the interactions between most
of them and then picking one that is the easiest to approach.

I was also setting up latex because I wanted to send the
statements of the problems to my supervisors and installing
the compiler is quite annoying. Essentially if you don't
search through the options well then it will try to install
every single latex package available. And for those not
familliar with latex - that's a lot. Then it takes 1,5 hours
to unpack all those useless things. Why choose to have Windows
on my work computer again? Pulling directly the packages
I want with Linux systems is so much easier. Oh well, I'll
manage I guess. Either that or reinstall my OS.


26-01-2023 Maybe back to the old ways?

First of all, I don't get why, but I get super stressed
about going to meetings. Probably it's the awful impact
that this whole internship had on me. Therefore I arrived
at work at like 2pm, which is not good for anyone and
especially my leaving early. I talked about it to my
supervisor during the meeting though, I'm not sure I'll
have time to take advantage of the psychological suppport
line today, but I probably should. I should actually 
promise myself to do it either today or tomorrow after
work.

Anyways, I put a thing in the title and don't worry, I'm not
giving up on doing stuff for Adblock. Just... my supervisor
showed me how to turn that problem into a research problem.
And solving that research problem sounds quite nice. And then
I can help explaining my paper on that research problem to
someone that will be actually developing Adblock based on that
paper. This way I can avoid coding. And that is so much better
for me because I hate coding so much. And more importantly I'm
solving a research problem, which is something I've done many
many many times. Not some practical stuff. Yet when someone
asks me what I'm doing for work, I can give them the Adblock
motivation. Becuase that's the real online-life problem that
I started from. It feels like the best of both worlds. Now
I just need to acquire the skill to turn real life problems
into math problems so that I can solve real life problems
using math.


25-01-2023 I am frustrated and going nowhere

So yea... Title. So why do I think that and where does the
frustration come from? Well first of all, I can't really test
whether what I understood works. Becuase I can't really write
code. And by that I mean that I could write code, but I asked
for a computer with Windows to avoid it. But then I've chosen
a practical topic, so I'm gonna end up coding things anyway.

Second of all my supervisors are both very busy this week. And
that's also to be expected and stuff, because I can see their
calendars and I knew they would be busy. Still annoying.
Especially because if I actually worked on Monday instead of
taking a day off I would know that I have those questions and
have them answered two days ago. Also questions is the wrong
word. I'd say the word I was looking for is frustrations.
I have an idea which doesn't really work. Then I have another
idea, but my algorithm needs to know certain things to realize
that idea. And I'm very not sure if I can know those things.
I guess I see how to formulate that as a question, just a long
one.

And the last one is even more problematic, because there is an
older PhD student that shares an office with me that worked
on this stuff before. Past tense very very improtant. And he's
nice and all, explaining things to me, but I just don't really
want to bother people asking about things they're not actively
involved in. Seems polite. Maybe it is really silly. I don't
want to have someone that doesn't like working with optimizations
to listen about the optimization I made and tell me whether it
could work from the technical standpoint. Also it's about the
experience and stuff. When I came here I really wanted
mentorship and this is really something I'm looking for in this
situation. So answering stuff like: do I want to learn coding
for this project? How much of it? Should I be continuing to
work on this? Is my idea feasible? Maybe I'm underestimating
my office-mate, but I really want a supervisor to answer a lot
of these questions, because I trust them a lot more.


24-01-2023 New stuff

So first of all, no post yesterday because I took a day off.
And that was because I can't really manage my own well-being,
especially on weekends. But this blog is mostly about working
as a PhD student, so I'm not going to get into the details
of how messed up my mental state is.

I moved onto the adblock thingies and I'm very unsure of what
I'm doing. I don't even know how to write about it. It is so
overwhelming. I don't think writing the algorithm I need is
going to be easy, because it's some sort of split up a lot of
things into pieces that look similar sorta thing. Those are
usually tough.

Also I was looking for documentation and I felt like it was
a bit messy. Yes, I curse you Google. Might be because I'm not
used to searching stuff for work straight up on the Internet,
but I much prefer to do so in papers. I could never find some
number that I really need too. So that's gonna wait for a bit.

Finally it is really nice that I can actually explain what I do
by just saying it. And people actually understand. For most 
people this is probably a normal feeling, but as a mathematician
it's so unusual and great. The non-great part is the fact that
the short description of what I'm doing is that I'm making
AdBlock worse. But it's not my fault, it's Google's fault, okay?


20-01-2023 Working on practical things

As you see in the title, I made the only correct choice
and decided to work on Adblock things. Since it's all new
to me I got tired very quickly, therefore this entry will
be rather short.

Security stuff is scary. This could be a whole another
paragraph, but apparently you can try to identify users by
ad-bombing them and checking which ones get blocked and
which ones do not. 

The whole ad stuff is a bit confusing to me as well. The thing
I'm doing should be very very simple from the theoretical
point of view, because it's just compressing some number of
expressions into a smaller one, which express the same thing.
And that is a very standard problem. Yet someone has to do it
and that someone is probably me.


19-01-2023 Research question time

So today, and it was surprising to me, I expected this
to happen next week, Pierre presented me the research
questions my supervisors were considering to give me for
the upcoming months. Since that happened at the start of
my workday (let me not talk about why the start of my
workday was at 1pm), I had trouble focusing on anything
else. There were 3 options, but for me this is essentially
1 major choice and 1 minor choice.

So the major choice is choosing between working on some
automata-related adblocker things or database theory. Why
is that major? I've never done anything even remotely close
to practical. I'm a math major after all. And now I have an
option to work on adblock, which is an incredibly practical
piece of software. And apparently I can apply my theoretical
knowledge there too. Sounds great doesn't it? It's almost
like... it sounds a bit too good. It seems to be checking
all the boxes for the things I've been missing in my 
academic career. But usually when a completely new thing checks
all the boxes, it also unticks some boxes that you had no
idea that were important to you.

Some little background that not all of you probably know.
When I was choosing my uni, I chose the one in the city
that I didn't know over the one my high school was in.
Then I ran a maths club while having ZERO idea on how
students' interests clubs are supposed to look like.
And finally I went for an internship to a country where
I could barely say a sentence in the only language most
people speak. And then I stayed in that country where
I can barely communicate with people, because I had an
opportunity for a new start in a different city, despite
the internship not finishing well. I have an active bias
towards jumping into new and potentially dangerous things.
But here there's doubt. I don't really know where the doubt
comes from. Maybe it's getting old. Maybe it's the part
where I learned over time how important these boxes I 
had no idea existed can be. And that's why the choice is
difficult.

I also mentioned that there was a minor choice, it's between
two database theory topics if I don't choose to go into
adblockers. And I can't even recall what the choices were,
that is how minor that choice is.



18-01-2023 Finishing up things

It seems as though I'm almost done with a thorough read
of my first paper during this PhD. And it might be something
that my work will be related to later. Anyways thorough reads
are a lot of work and time - this one took me 2 weeks. It
should get faster as I learn the terminology used in database
theory, but for now it'll be taking a while.

Also I would like to give an apology to the other 2 notions
of provenance which I called not pretty or useless in some
previous blog. Because not every ideal notion is always
accessible. And this is what the other 2 notions are. They
aren't the prettiest, but at least they're always computable
and you can always talk to them about your data. And that's
very appreciated.

I also just learned that my doctorate school needs to be called
in order to give me my documents or register me. Sigh! I guess
I'll do it when I get back home.

And finally I went through some paper that tries to perform
operations on data which is stored in the compact way. And 
that's usually cool. But the operations they're performing
are related to machine learning. I don't know a thing about
machine learning. I guess I'll have to learn. Or skip that
part. I like skipping that part.


17-01-2023 I'm impressed by my supervisor

I had a meeting today. And during that meeting I've learnt
that one of my supervisors knows absolutely nothing about
what I've been doing in the last 2 weeks. So why did I put
in the title that I'm impressed? It's because my stuff is
really far from his domain, yet he's still trying to listen
and learn what I'm talking about. And that is not a behavior
I'm used to after spending 5 years at Univesity of Warsaw.
Generally I remember that whenever I'd ask a question that
wasn't in the domain of some of my old teachers, they'd try
to redirect me to someone who is more in the domain. Then
person they'd redirect me too wouldn't be too interested
and the topic would die out. So I am very very glad that
this is not the case here.

Also short days are quite nice. I feel a bit tired after the
meeting and I'm taking the afternoon off today to talk to
family and figure out some stuff at home as well. Yet I feel
like I've done a lot, so that is pretty good I think.

I noticed that writing these blogs takes me like 5 minutes too
rather than 30, like it did at the start, so I should probably
look for some new excuse as to why I don't read papers in the
last hour of my work. Or maybe just read the papers or do some
other stuff that's actually useful for work. Nah, I'll maybe
work on my website.


16-01-2023 Wandering into forest of semirings

Hi there! I'm in a good mood because that's what productive
days do to me. Surprising, right?!

So why was this day very productive? I have no idea really
about the work-organizational reasons, but I'll just write
as much as I remember for what happened early in the day.
If I do the same thing about multiple days when I ended up
in a good mood maybe the correlation will show me a way to
make having good days be a routine rather than an exception.

I didn't really sleep all that much, I had a super lazy morning
and I didn't feel like today was gonna be great. I was pretty
strongly distracted in the metro, I showed up at work at around
11:30, so I figured I'd skip lunch so that I can maybe leave
around roughly 7 hours and not feel too bad about it. Then
I started doing some simple administrative stuff which took
like an hour but wasn't too tiring. And finally after that I
think I reluctantly sat down to reading papers. Oh, before
papers are also made a TODO list and that was probably very
helpful for my mood.

What really made me happy was the fact that I got to experiment
with a certain semiring, which is a called tropical. And it
was important for my work, because there is a mathematically
pretty notion of provenance (if you recall some blog about 
a week ago that I posted provenance is something that tells
you where your knowledge came from), which usually isn't easy
to compute, but if you consider it over a tropical semiring,
then it becomes easy to compute. And that's great!.
So I started searching for semirings that'd behave similarly
to the tropical one and looking for the notion of a semiring
that'd capture the behavior of all semirings where my pretty
notion of provenance is easy to compute.


13-01-2023 Not focused

Basically a description of today. I found it really difficult
to focus on anything or do anything at work. Might have 
something to do with noticing that a game I play in my free
time got an exciting patch in the morning and really wanting
to try it? Anyways, it felt so not good I might try to count
this as half a day off, because there was no progress at all.

This is also a downside of being dilligent about administrative
things you can do - there is none of them left for when your
brain just doesn't work.

Now that I'm looking at my meeting notes I've noticed that
I even made a note that setting up a website would be this
proactive procastenation. I wish I tried doing that, but I
guess I didn't.

I've also heard from my supervisors that having 3 papers I'm
working on is not a bad thing at all as you can come back
to them and remember them better thanks to that. I also know
that I should read and try to remember as much as possible
at this stage since I don't know what will become useful yet.
Though honestly... I can't wait until I have a scientific
topic so that I can know what I need and what I don't need
and start working towards a goal instead.


12-01-2023 New Year's celebration day I guess?

I feel like I spent a lot of time today not working... 
Yea, something like 4 hours of my 7,5h day. And that is with
considering writing this blog as part of my workday, which
it is to some extend. Hey, it makes me try to put all the
research I worked on into not only my own words, but words
that are understandable to a *wider audience* also known as
my friends.

Anyways, first of all there was a lunch break and those are
pretty long. In fact when I met a person from Human Resources
team to explain me how working here looks like, I learnt that
the lunch break is mandatory and it's supposed to take between
45 minutes and 2 hours. I'll take that. But that's normal. Then
I took my standard 15 minute break and I saw some people playing
table soccer downstairs and someone was winning 1v2 way too
easily, so I joined his team to nerf him. It worked :P Finally
I tried to get back to work and then there was some celebration
when director of this research center was telling us about how
amazing we did last year and how amazing we are or something.
Cool. We also got galette, which is some French dessert, it was
pretty great. And after I came back to my office I noticed that
I want to leave in an hour. So there went the whole day.

I can still say a couple of things about research, because this
blog is a bit pointless if I don't? So people that don't explain
a notation in a definition that's central to the paper are 
really annoying. And also you can use graphs with fancy labels
to store data without really harming your ability to ask
questions about it. And it makes sense to not copy that every
presentation of Cries and Whispers was directed by Bergman
(I have no idea about movies, I'm taking that example from a
book on databases) or Ullman plays in every presentation of
Cries and Whispers, but storing all the information well
requires some creativity. Graphical representations are helpful.


11-01-2023 I don't feel like I'm doing much

I started feeling why being a PhD and especially starting one
can be really difficult at times. It really feels like I'm
just trying to study papers with very little progress done
each month and nothing comes out of it. But then I talked to
my supervisor about this, and apparently taking a week to read
a paper throughly is completely normal, not only that, he said
that it's really good if I manage to thoroughly understand the
paper I was working on in a week. I was stunned by this,
because I normally wouldn't expect taking a week to read a
10-page long document. But I guess that's how researcher life
works. 

I also am trying to learn some other than thorough ways
to read a paper. One of them is supposed to come down to just
reading the introduction and summary and deducing what paper
is about from them. The problem is what if a paper doesn't
have a proper introduction and a summary. Becuase people do
that. Why? Who knows. 

Oh also apparently throwing in spikey brackets around words
in a text documents makes .md files not show what's inside.
I removed them so that the end of yesterday's post makes sense.


10-01-2023 Sleeping is good

I've decided to sleep for like 4 hours after sleeping 3 the 
previous day and then go straight into a meeting with my
supervisor. I was super sleepy and couldn't really understand
a thing. So for all PhD students that somehow made it work during
the undergrad/masters - it only really worked because those
studies just aren't that hard. If you wanna actually be able
to work properly, you gotta sleep properly too.

The other realization I had is that being a PhD student is
a wonderful job, but with that wonderful job also comes
a responsibilty to show up to your work ready. And I want to
show up to work ready because what I'm doing is great. None
of this staying up all night for very little reason nonsense.

I've learnt things about the reasons why things didn't make any
sense to me yesterday when reading the paper. Apparently they
wanted to start with properties, but they couldn't prove the
properties -> unique object implication, therefore they had to
settle on some things used in practice -> their properties.


9-01-2023 Practical is still strange to me

This might be fault of the fact that I slept 3 hours 
or so during the night, but I had a lot of trouble 
grasping concepts today. As a mathematician whenever 
I try to invent a concept that measures something 
or gives me information, I tend to first think of
what do I want from this thing. And today I've ran
into about 10 definitions of various notions of provenance
in a paper (provenance is meant to be some mathematical object
that gives you ready information about the data you have without
having to search for it, at least as far as I understand, 
maybe that's wrong). And having 10 different variants of a certain
measure is fine, because you might use a different one
depending on what you want. But later in the paper I've
learnt, that only 2 of these notions for decent mathematical
objects with nice properties of... for example, always having 
a definition or being able to manage updating the data. 
The worst part is, I read the first notion last week 
and I figured that first notion was a little silly, 
so I came up with how you'd do an improved version of it. 
Guess what, the first notion and the notion I came up are
the only two that have good properties. I'm meeting my 
supervisor tomorrow, hopefully I'll get an explanation to
why all these other notions are mentioned at all, because 
in my eyes they're just useless right now.

6-01-2023 Hello world (of databases)!

New year, new me! Or something like that... All of these new year resolutions where you completely change the way you're doing things work 100% of the time, right..? Well this whole 45/15 techinque or whatever it's called has been working well for a week so that's something. And I also have to have a work calendar, so at least something is organized.

Moving onto maths... I'm saying I'm working on database theory, but what does that really mean? Well a database is just a set of things you know, i.e. facts. Since you're not only smart, but you also studied things for a while, you know a lot. Therefore databases are big. Despite being smart, you probably know that one guy that doesn't really study much, but can figure almost anything out with a speed of a computer program when you tell them him the data from your database of knowledge. Let's call that guy a Datalog program. If you imagine what a person could be if you combined your knowledge and his deduction skills, that hypothetical person could be a rolemodel for many students, therefore we call it a model. And that's a quick real-life explanation to terms used in databases. Oh well terms... that's also a term, but I don't think anyone needs to actually know the way of that one.

Now imagine that your knowledge base is a set of axioms and you want to figure out if your favorite theorem requires axiom of infinity for example. Actually, no, you're cool, so of course it requires the axiom of infinity. Let's go with the axiom of powerset. And not only that, you'd like to also measure how much it relies on the axiom of infinity. Well I have a recipe for you. Recall all the facts that you're using in the proof of your favorite theorem and draw a downwards line from it to each of those facts to the theorem. Then take the proofs of those facts and repeat, until you get to axioms. And then do that for every possible proof. Then you assign a value x to axiom of infinity and value y to the axiom of powerset and 1 to all other axioms. And then for each proof you multiply the values assigned to axioms that show up at the bottom and you add them all up. Oh, infinity is a number now. If your result has a monomial without a y, then you have a proof that doesn't require the axiom of powerset. And if you have x^infinity somewhere there, then you're really cool. This example probably works better on a table of movies, theater locations and the Pariscope (weekly publication that lists cultural events in Paris), but the point of math is to be pretty, not practical :)

I'll try to do these daily, at least on weekdays because I'm supposed to write about what I worked on during the day anyways. And this is a fun way of doing it.
